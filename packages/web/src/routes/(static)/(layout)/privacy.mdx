# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

Your privacy matters to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our Warehouse System application.

## What We Collect

We only collect the minimum amount of data necessary to operate our platform and improve your experience.

### Account Information
- Name
- Email address
- Role and permissions
- Authentication metadata

### Operational Data
- Product and inventory updates
- Order creation and fulfillment records
- Device events and sync statuses
- Timestamps and logs

### Communication Data
- Emails and notifications sent
- Webhook payloads (if configured)

We do **not** collect:
- Location data
- Biometric data
- Credit card numbers (unless integrated with external services)

## How We Use Your Data

We use your data to:

- Maintain your account and access control
- Ensure your warehouse systems run smoothly
- Provide synchronization between local and cloud systems
- Send you operational emails (e.g., order status, alerts)
- Help you track device and order events

## Local vs. Cloud Data

Our system is designed with a local-first approach. This means most of your operational data (orders, inventory, device logs) **can remain on your infrastructure**. You decide what gets synchronized to the cloud.

- **Cloud Storage**: For backups, remote access, or integrations
- **Local Storage**: For fast, private, and offline use

## Cookies and Tracking

We do **not** use tracking cookies or analytics services unless explicitly enabled by the system administrator. Sessions are stored securely and expire after inactivity.

## Third-Party Services

If you use optional features such as:
- Email (e.g., AWS SES, Mailgun)
- Webhooks
- Payments (e.g., Stripe)

Then your data may be processed by those services according to their privacy policies.

## Data Retention

You are in control of your data. By default, we:

- Retain logs for up to 30 days
- Keep order and product data indefinitely unless deleted by an admin
- Provide options to export or delete your data upon request

## Your Rights

You have the right to:

- Request access to your data
- Export or delete your account
- Report any misuse of your data
- Opt out of communication
