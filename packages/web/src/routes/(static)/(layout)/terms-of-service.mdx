# Terms of Service

## Acceptance of Terms

By using the Warehouse System, you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, you may not use the application.

## Use of the Service

You are allowed to use the system for lawful business operations, internal workflows, and integrations that comply with applicable regulations.

You may **not**:

- Use the system for fraudulent activities
- Disrupt or attempt to breach system security
- Reverse-engineer any proprietary parts of the system (unless licensed to do so)

## Access and Availability

We strive to maintain 99.9% uptime. However, there may be occasional maintenance, updates, or outages (especially for cloud services).

If you use the **offline/local mode**, you're responsible for keeping your local system healthy and backed up.

## Licensing and Ownership

All content, software, and designs are the property of the Warehouse System team unless otherwise stated. We grant you a **non-exclusive, non-transferable license** to use the platform according to your subscription or deployment agreement.

Custom modules or plugins you create remain yours unless integrated into the core product under mutual agreement.

## Third-Party Integrations

Our system may connect to external services such as:
- Cloud storage
- Payment processors
- Email or SMS gateways
- IoT platforms

You are responsible for ensuring compliance with their terms.

## Termination

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access if:

- You breach these terms
- Your usage harms the system or other users
- You engage in illegal or abusive behavior

## Limitation of Liability

We are not liable for:

- Data loss due to misconfigured local deployments
- Interruptions caused by third-party services
- Downtime caused by force majeure

We provide the platform **as-is** and **as available**, without warranty or guarantee of fitness for a particular purpose.

## Changes to the Terms

These terms may be updated from time to time. You will be notified of major changes. Continued use of the system after changes means you accept the new terms.
