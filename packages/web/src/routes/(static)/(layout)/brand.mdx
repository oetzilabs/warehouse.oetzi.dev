# Brand Guidelines

## Our Identity
The Warehouse System is built to feel **practical, powerful, and minimal**. Everything about the brand reflects a focus on clarity, function, and trustworthiness — from our colors and fonts to the tone of voice we use.


## Logo Usage
Our logo should be:

- Clear and readable at any size
- Placed with sufficient padding on all sides
- Not altered or distorted in any way

You may use a monochrome version on dark or light backgrounds depending on context. Always maintain contrast and legibility.

If you need assets, download our logo kit or contact design@our-warehouse-system.dev.

## Colors
We use a minimal color palette to stay focused and avoid distractions.

- **Primary**: `#4f46e5` (Dark Gray Blue) <div style="background-color:#4f46e5;width:24px;height:24px;border-radius:4px;"></div>
- **Accent**: `#27272a` (Tech Blue) <div style="background-color:#27272a;width:24px;height:24px;border-radius:4px;"></div>


## Typography
We use a clean sans-serif typeface for all interfaces and written materials.

- **Headings**: Lisu Bosa
- **Primary Font**: Inter, system UI fallback
- **Secondary Font**: Geist Mono Variable, monospace

Avoid decorative fonts or overuse of italics. Consistency matters more than creativity here.


## Iconography and Layout
We use sharp, simple icons  with strong geometry from [lucide.dev](https://lucide.dev). Layouts should prioritize structure and hierarchy — think **grids**, **clear contrast**, and **intentional whitespace**.
