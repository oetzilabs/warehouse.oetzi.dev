# About the Creator

## A One-Person Project — by Design

This warehouse system is built and maintained by one developer with a clear goal:  
To create a reliable logistics platform that doesn't rely on bloated enterprise software or constant internet access.

It's not a startup. It's not a funded team. It's a focused, solo effort — designed with care, driven by real-world frustrations, and built to solve actual problems.

This system is built around principles I care about:

- Open source and transparent.
- Full control, no vendor lock-in.
- Extensible and developer-friendly by default.

## What I Do

Everything from scratch:

- **Code**: Frontend (SolidJS), backend (TypeScript + Effect-TS), database (Drizzle-ORM + PostgreSQL), MQTT, and CLI tooling
- **Design**: UI/UX, layout, flow, copywriting
- **Infra**: Deployment (via [SST](https://sst.dev) and Docker), local device sync, fallback modes

## How I Work

- I test most of the codebase locally before it goes into production
- I avoid third-party dependencies unless absolutely needed
  - Thrid-Party libraries are listed [here](./third-party)
- I ship when it's stable — not when the deadline says so

## Want to Collaborate?

Even though this is a solo project, I’m always open to feedback, ideas, or integration help.
