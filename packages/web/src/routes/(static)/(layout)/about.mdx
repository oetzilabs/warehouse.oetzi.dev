# About Our Warehouse System

## What We Do
We are building a **modular and modern warehouse management system** designed for small to mid-sized logistics and fulfillment businesses. Our platform aims to streamline operations across departments, from inventory and product tracking to order handling, shipping, and device control.

Our core belief is that warehouse software should be **robust, offline-friendly, easy to extend**, and able to **integrate with modern hardware and IoT devices**. Every part of the system is designed to be understandable, maintainable, and predictable.

## Why We're Building This
Warehousing and logistics tools are often bloated, inflexible, and hard to use. We've experienced this firsthand. This project was born out of necessity, frustration, and a vision to build something **lean, functional, and future-proof**.

We want to help businesses focus on what they do best — storing, organizing, shipping, and tracking — while we take care of the systems underneath.

## Our Mission
Our mission is to build an open, transparent, and powerful system that:

- **Supports everyday workflows** in warehouses and logistics
- **Bridges the gap** between cloud services and offline/fallback-capable local systems
- **Offers integration with modern tools** (CLI, APIs, MQTT, IoT, etc.)
- **Is developer-first** and provides a solid foundation for extensions and automation

## Principles We Follow
- **Human-focused**: The system must help operators and admins — not get in their way.
- **Transparent**: Clear logging, event tracking, and admin tools give you full insight into the system.
- **Modular**: Components like order handling, inventory, devices, and payments can be used independently or together.
- **Interoperable**: Expose all relevant actions via APIs, events, or webhooks.
- **Offline-first**: We are attempting local-first data sync and failover support are core parts of the platform.

## Key System Areas
### Core Features
- **Product Management**: Add, update, or remove products in your sortiment.
- **User and Access Control**: Manage employees and their roles securely.
- **Order Management**: Create and manage customer orders and printable order sheets.
- **Inventory Overview**: Monitor incoming, outgoing, and stored stock.

### Advanced Modules (In Progress)
- **POS System**: A point-of-sale terminal that syncs with the cloud via local services.
- **Device Management**: IoT-ready, via MQTT brokers and a robust device registry.
- **E-Mail & Notification System**: Automatic updates for stakeholders.
- **API & CLI Tooling**: Developer-first integration and automation support.

## Local and Cloud Integration
### Dual MQTT Setup
Our system offers **two-way MQTT communication**:

- **Local MQTT Broker**: For in-facility devices and fallback operations.
- **Cloud MQTT Broker**: Centralized control and logging.
- **Fallback Support**: If the cloud fails, your devices and workflows continue via the local broker.

This allows our system to support **offline operations** and **deferred sync** when internet is restored.

## Developer Ecosystem
We are building a set of tools for internal teams and external developers:

- A **CLI tool** to run, configure, and operate the system headlessly.
- A **modular API** with endpoints for all major resources.
- A **Webhook System** for real-time updates.
- **Extensive docs** with examples, schemas, and integration recipes.

We want to make it easy to extend, plug in devices, sync data, or build apps on top of our system.

## Looking Forward
This is a long-term project. We are building it with care, intention, and a deep respect for simplicity and resilience. Our aim is to offer a solution that doesn't lock you in but instead gives you **control, clarity, and adaptability**.

Whether you're managing a single facility or coordinating a distributed warehouse network, our goal is to make your day smoother, not more complicated.

## Who This Is For
- **Warehouse operators** needing a better toolset.
- **Developers and integrators** wanting reliable APIs and hardware integration.
- **Founders or small logistics businesses** trying to avoid the chaos of outdated enterprise tools.
- **Makers and hackers** interested in low-level hardware or automation.

## Get Involved
We're actively working on opening the platform up for contributors and organizations. Whether you're interested in testing, developing, or suggesting features, we welcome input and feedback.
